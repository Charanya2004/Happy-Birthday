<p>You have always held a special place in my life and will hold in the future too. You have helped me in many ways more than you know, you have been with me through my hard times, from being as an emotional support to an annoying brother.Honestly, I miss when you used to be yourself, and I tried my best efforts to support you through your emotional phase,though I dont even know if my efforts were visible. I dont regret any of my moments with you, and Im actually happier remembering those.
Im not ignoring or avoiding you, Im just giving you some space to collect yourself. In the end, I'll always be here for you, and care for you. And you can always count on me. Have a great year ahead!</p>
